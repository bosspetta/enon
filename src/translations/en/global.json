All my knowledge builds on each other, has always been studied and filtered by me, lived, experienced and directed to be able to transmit it to others, always made from the pleasure, curiosity or desire to know myself more and better, and learn to manage my life in all aspects, including finally the questioning of all teachings, until I can find my own truth.",

            "paragraph-1": "Yoga is like a lantern, a light that guides us to walk from the outside, with its swells and storms, towards our inner self, where we find the firm and serene land. Its objective is mental calm, serenity, it is about creating conditions of listening and inner space, this means awakening sensitivity and opening our heart in every moment of the practice to reach a meditative state through silence. The process to reach this goal is to stabilise the body, the breath and the mind in a progressive, stable and comfortable way.",
            "paragraph-2": "Hatha Yoga is a precise science that helps us to recognise ourselves in our humanity through action, generating a state of calm and at the same time of alertness that allows us to know the nature of our mind. The means it uses are precise. The first is Āsana, understood as the development of awareness on the bodily level, understanding its tensions and its states, the effects of Āsana are accentuated by Prāṇāyāma, the awareness of the lengthening of the breath. Both will progressively lead us to develop the state of Meditation. This is a broad awareness that encompasses a large part of our reality.",
            "paragraph-3": "The way of Hatha Yoga is the way of the body, since everything passes through the body, it is necessary to pass through the consciousness of the body to access the experience of the SELF."

These specialities give me a great insight into the human body, its physiology and anatomy. Other studies on humanistic psychology are also important «ingredients» of Yoga enON, on which I support my personal development, believing in the recovery of the capacity we all have to live in the present, spontaneity and responsibility. I conceive of the person as a whole entity made up of body, mind and soul, who can achieve well-being by working for the integrity and balance of these three indissoluble parts.",
            "p2": "I tailor my classes to suit the needs of the students who make up the groups at any given time. Without losing the original practice that Hatha Yoga taught me, but adapting to more western needs, at the same time I try to practice from an approach of softness, liveliness and tenderness towards ourselves, avoiding ostentatious or harmful proposals, which take us away from the true practice.",
            "p3": "We do not practice by levels, or by years of seniority, or by acquired knowledge. Yoga inON understands that the «correct practice», if well taught, will work for all levels. In the same way, well explained knowledge can be grasped at different levels of understanding. But one is not truer than the other, only deeper. Many times, believing that we already understand something leads us precisely to not experiencing it. I sincerely believe that it doesn't matter so much what level we think we have, I think it is more interesting the possibility of opening ourselves to the understanding and processing of the experience, there are no levels, only the possibility of surrender and commitment."
